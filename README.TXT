Appliance Algorithm

Description:
A program that uses a basic algorithm to decide what devices and what rooms to turn on and off basic on a maximum wattage provided by the user.
It reads in a text file of appliances that contains comma seperated information such as watt usage or if it is a smart device, and assigns them 
to rooms. The amount of devices in a room can range from 5-10, based on a random number generator. The algorithm decides whether it is better to
"brown out" entire rooms or turn individual smart devices to low. Individual devices cannot be turned off.  

The program requires a comma seperated file called "ApplianceDetail.txt"
